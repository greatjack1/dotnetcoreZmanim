## dotnetcoreZmanim

This project is a complete working web api to generate zemanim (Jewish Calendar Times) for any location in the world.

## Architecture

One of the primary goals of this project was for me to brush up on my program design skills. Due to this I decided to go with a classic MVC approach which keeps the code organized and clearly defines the role of each class.

## Motivation

The motivation for this project was from a friend of mine who complained how the myzmanim.com api costs 15 dollars a month. I created this to provide a free alternative for developers to use when they require a free platform independent web api for zemanim.

## Usage

To use a prehosted version of this app. Go to [https://wyrezmanim.herokuapp.com](https://wyrezmanim.herokuapp.com)

## Self Hosting

If you would like to host this app yourself. You can do so on any platform that supports asp.net core. A couple of cloud providers that do support asp.net core include heroku, aws, azure and digital ocean.

## Contributors

The api was solely designed and implemented by Yaakov from the WYRE corp
